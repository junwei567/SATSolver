Sat Solver
===

SUTD ISTD Term 4 Project. 

The Boolean satisfiability problem is the issue of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. 

A SAT Solver is a program that solves the satisfiability problem where given a formula, it will either return an assignment that makes it true or return no such assignment exists.

Our SAT Solver uses the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, which is a backtracking-based search algorithm to decide the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.

## Getting Started

1. Place the project into your preferred Java IDE
2. open `src.sat.SATSolverTest`
